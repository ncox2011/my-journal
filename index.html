      <p>Excited to learn</p>
      <p>If you make changes save them in text editor and then update in command, you can push it up to gitHub using each file name.
          you can use the git add to add each file that was updated, then git commit -m to add a message about what changes were made
          and to commit the files, at any time you can type git status to see the status of the files, at the end use the command gpo master 
          to push it up to gitHub.</p>

       <p>Learned how to write to the DOM using JavaScript.  I don't fully
           understand it, but I did it.
           I had extremely messy code that was hard to read, had to update
           the layout.
