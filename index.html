      <p>I know nothing</p>
      <p>Excited to learn</p>
      <p>If you make changes save them in text editor and then update in command, you can push it up to gitHub using each file name.
          you can use the git add to add each file that was updated, then git commit -m to add a message about what changes were made
          and to commit the files, at any time you can type git status to see the status of the files, at the end use the command gpo master 
          to push it up to gitHub.</p>

       <p>Learned how to write to the DOM using JavaScript.  I don't fully
           understand it, but I did it.
           I had extremely messy code that was hard to read, had to update
           the layout.

    <h1>Week of May 28th 2018</h1>
    <p>We have been learning about Objects and pushing to the DOM.  Yesterday (Wednesday) we had our first group project using GitHub.  Our team
        worked well together, communicating what we needed and trying to ensure as little overlap as possible to prevent merge conflicts.  If I were
        to change something, I would have insisted we collaborate together more on the main CSS page.  We sort of ended up letting one person merge them all
        on the page.  The coolest part about seeing each group presentation is that I learn a lot about ways to do things differently next time by seeing
        what they did.  I have been struggling with the JavaScript part of the object assignment.  The functions needed to change the objects in an 
        object or an array in an object within an object all run together.  I keep trying things that don't work.  I need to ask for more help!  Thankfully,
        there is a tutoring/practice session tomorrow afternoon on JavaScript.
